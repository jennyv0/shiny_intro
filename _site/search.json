    "text": "CSS\nSo what is CSS?\nCSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a styling language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG or XHTML).\nCSS allows you to specify how HTML elements should appear on the screen or in other media. This includes properties such as color, size, font, spacing, and positioning and enables the separation of content (HTML) from presentation (styling). This separation makes it easier to manage and update the appearance of a website or document without needing to alter the underlying content.\nTake a look at the example below:\n/* Selecting all paragraphs */\np {\n   /* Declaration Block */\n   color: blue; /* Setting text color to blue */\n   font-size: 16px; /* Setting font size to 16 pixels */\n   margin-top: 20px; /* Setting top margin to 20 pixels */\n}\nIn this example, p is the selector targeting all &lt;p&gt; elements in the HTML document. The declaration block inside the curly braces contains three declarations setting the text color, font size, and top margin for those paragraphs.\n&lt;div&gt;\nIn the example below:\nThe HTML code creates a webpage with a &lt;div&gt; element having a class attribute set to “container”. Inside this &lt;div&gt;, there are two paragraphs.\nThe CSS code (in a separate file named styles.css linked to the HTML document) applies styles specifically to the elements with the class “container”. It sets the background color to light blue, adds padding, and creates a border around the container.\n&lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n    &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"&gt;\n    &lt;title&gt;HTML and CSS Example&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\"&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=\"container\"&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph inside a div with class \"container\".&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;This is another paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n/* CSS for the class \"container\" */\n.container {\n    background-color: lightblue; /* Setting background color to light blue */\n    padding: 20px; /* Adding padding of 20 pixels */\n    border: 1px solid darkblue; /* Adding a border with 1 pixel width and dark blue color */\n}",

Shiny turns this code into a web app. For example, in the script below, the Shiny script actually outputs the commented HTML script at the end:\nFrom: Customize your UI with HTML\nfluidPage(\n\n  # App title ----\n  titlePanel(\"Hello Shiny!\"),\n\n  # Sidebar layout with input and output definitions ----\n  sidebarLayout(\n\n    # Sidebar panel for inputs ----\n    sidebarPanel(\n\n      # Input: Slider for the number of bins ----\n      sliderInput(inputId = \"bins\",\n                  label = \"Number of bins:\",\n                  min = 1,\n                  max = 50,\n                  value = 30)\n\n    ),\n\n    # Main panel for displaying outputs ----\n    mainPanel(\n\n      # Output: Histogram ----\n      plotOutput(outputId = \"distPlot\")\n\n    )\n  )\n)\n\n## &lt;div class=\"container-fluid\"&gt;\n##   &lt;h2&gt;Hello Shiny!&lt;/h2&gt;\n##   &lt;div class=\"row\"&gt;\n##     &lt;div class=\"col-sm-4\"&gt;\n##       &lt;form class=\"well\"&gt;\n##         &lt;div class=\"form-group shiny-input-container\"&gt;\n##           &lt;label class=\"control-label\" for=\"bins\"&gt;Number of bins:&lt;/label&gt;\n##           &lt;input class=\"js-range-slider\" id=\"bins\" data-min=\"1\" data-max=\"50\" data-from=\"30\" ## data-step=\"1\" data-grid=\"true\" data-grid-num=\"9.8\" data-grid-snap=\"false\" ## data-prettify-separator=\",\" data-prettify-enabled=\"true\" data-keyboard=\"true\" ## data-keyboard-step=\"2.04081632653061\" data-data-type=\"number\"/&gt;\n##         &lt;/div&gt;\n##       &lt;/form&gt;\n##     &lt;/div&gt;\n##     &lt;div class=\"col-sm-8\"&gt;\n##       &lt;div id=\"distPlot\" class=\"shiny-plot-output\" style=\"width: 100% ; height: 400px\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n##     &lt;/div&gt;\n##   &lt;/div&gt;\n## &lt;/div&gt; \nFirst, let’s look at the syntax again, used to create the HTML example above:\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;My First Heading&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;This is what a second heading looks like &lt;/h2&gt;\n\n  &lt;h2&gt;Steps to Make a Sandwich&lt;/h2&gt;\n  &lt;ol&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Gather Ingredients&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Spread condiments on bread&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Add desired fillings&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Place second slice of bread on top&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Cut the sandwich in half&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n###There are a couple of ways to use that code in a Shiny app:\nBoth ways below result in the following UI:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Translate the HTML code into R code:\nlibrary(shiny)\n\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  tags$h1(\"My First Heading\"),\n  tags$p(\"My first paragraph.\"),\n  \n  tags$h2(\"This is what a second heading looks like\"),\n  \n  tags$h2(\"Steps to Make a Sandwich\"),\n  tags$ol(\n    tags$li(\"Gather Ingredients\"),\n    tags$li(\"Spread condiments on bread\"),\n    tags$li(\"Add desired fillings\"),\n    tags$li(\"Place second slice of bread on top\"),\n    tags$li(\"Cut the sandwich in half\")\n  )\n)\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n  # Server logic goes here\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\nIt is recommended to use the second method, be is it more flexible and allows for widgets and other things to be dispersed among the HTML code.\ntags shiny::tags is a list of 110 functions. Each function builds a specific HTML tag. You can learn what the most common tags do in the Shiny HTML tags glossary.\n\nlibrary(shiny)\n\nnames(tags)\n\n  [1] \"a\"                   \"abbr\"                \"address\"            \n  [4] \"animate\"             \"animateMotion\"       \"animateTransform\"   \n  [7] \"area\"                \"article\"             \"aside\"              \n [10] \"audio\"               \"b\"                   \"base\"               \n [13] \"bdi\"                 \"bdo\"                 \"blockquote\"         \n [16] \"body\"                \"br\"                  \"button\"             \n [19] \"canvas\"              \"caption\"             \"circle\"             \n [22] \"cite\"                \"clipPath\"            \"code\"               \n [25] \"col\"                 \"colgroup\"            \"color-profile\"      \n [28] \"command\"             \"data\"                \"datalist\"           \n [31] \"dd\"                  \"defs\"                \"del\"                \n [34] \"desc\"                \"details\"             \"dfn\"                \n [37] \"dialog\"              \"discard\"             \"div\"                \n [40] \"dl\"                  \"dt\"                  \"ellipse\"            \n [43] \"em\"                  \"embed\"               \"eventsource\"        \n [46] \"feBlend\"             \"feColorMatrix\"       \"feComponentTransfer\"\n [49] \"feComposite\"         \"feConvolveMatrix\"    \"feDiffuseLighting\"  \n [52] \"feDisplacementMap\"   \"feDistantLight\"      \"feDropShadow\"       \n [55] \"feFlood\"             \"feFuncA\"             \"feFuncB\"            \n [58] \"feFuncG\"             \"feFuncR\"             \"feGaussianBlur\"     \n [61] \"feImage\"             \"feMerge\"             \"feMergeNode\"        \n [64] \"feMorphology\"        \"feOffset\"            \"fePointLight\"       \n [67] \"feSpecularLighting\"  \"feSpotLight\"         \"feTile\"             \n [70] \"feTurbulence\"        \"fieldset\"            \"figcaption\"         \n [73] \"figure\"              \"filter\"              \"footer\"             \n [76] \"foreignObject\"       \"form\"                \"g\"                  \n [79] \"h1\"                  \"h2\"                  \"h3\"                 \n [82] \"h4\"                  \"h5\"                  \"h6\"                 \n [85] \"hatch\"               \"hatchpath\"           \"head\"               \n [88] \"header\"              \"hgroup\"              \"hr\"                 \n [91] \"html\"                \"i\"                   \"iframe\"             \n [94] \"image\"               \"img\"                 \"input\"              \n [97] \"ins\"                 \"kbd\"                 \"keygen\"             \n[100] \"label\"               \"legend\"              \"li\"                 \n[103] \"line\"                \"linearGradient\"      \"link\"               \n[106] \"main\"                \"map\"                 \"mark\"               \n[109] \"marker\"              \"mask\"                \"menu\"               \n[112] \"meta\"                \"metadata\"            \"meter\"              \n[115] \"mpath\"               \"nav\"                 \"noscript\"           \n[118] \"object\"              \"ol\"                  \"optgroup\"           \n[121] \"option\"              \"output\"              \"p\"                  \n[124] \"param\"               \"path\"                \"pattern\"            \n[127] \"picture\"             \"polygon\"             \"polyline\"           \n[130] \"pre\"                 \"progress\"            \"q\"                  \n[133] \"radialGradient\"      \"rb\"                  \"rect\"               \n[136] \"rp\"                  \"rt\"                  \"rtc\"                \n[139] \"ruby\"                \"s\"                   \"samp\"               \n[142] \"script\"              \"section\"             \"select\"             \n[145] \"set\"                 \"slot\"                \"small\"              \n[148] \"solidcolor\"          \"source\"              \"span\"               \n[151] \"stop\"                \"strong\"              \"style\"              \n[154] \"sub\"                 \"summary\"             \"sup\"                \n[157] \"svg\"                 \"switch\"              \"symbol\"             \n[160] \"table\"               \"tbody\"               \"td\"                 \n[163] \"template\"            \"text\"                \"textarea\"           \n[166] \"textPath\"            \"tfoot\"               \"th\"                 \n[169] \"thead\"               \"time\"                \"title\"              \n[172] \"tr\"                  \"track\"               \"tspan\"              \n[175] \"u\"                   \"ul\"                  \"use\"                \n[178] \"var\"                 \"video\"               \"view\"               \n[181] \"wbr\"                \n\n\nExample:\nTo HTML div tag equvalent is below:\ntags$div()\n## &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; \nClass attributes\nTo add a class attribute to the div header, you would do the below:\ntags$div(class = \"header\")\n## &lt;div class=\"header\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\nChildren\nEach tag function will add unnamed arguments to your tag as HTML children. This addition lets you nest tags inside of each other (just as in HTML).\ntags$div(class = \"header\", checked = NA,\n  tags$p(\"Ready to take the Shiny tutorial? If so\"),\n  tags$a(href = \"shiny.posit.co/tutorial\", \"Click Here!\")\n)\n## &lt;div class=\"header\" checked&gt;\n##   &lt;p&gt;Ready to take the Shiny tutorial?

You can also wrap all of your HTML code into a HTML() function\nYou cannot put raw HTML directly into a tag or UI object (like in the example below). Shiny will treat raw HTML as a character string, adding HTML as text to your UI document.\ntags$div(\n  \"&lt;strong&gt;Raw HTML!&lt;/strong&gt;\"\n)\n## &lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raw HTML!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt; \nTo add raw HTML, use the HTML function. HTML takes a character string and returns it as HTML (a special class of object in Shiny).\nlibrary(shiny)\n\n# Define UI for application that draws a histogram\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  \n  HTML('\n&lt;h1&gt;My First Heading&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;This is what a second heading looks like &lt;/h2&gt;\n\n  &lt;h2&gt;Steps to Make a Sandwich&lt;/h2&gt;\n  &lt;ol&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Gather Ingredients&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Spread condiments on bread&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Add desired fillings&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Place second slice of bread on top&lt;/li&gt;\n      &lt;li&gt;Cut the sandwich in half&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;/ol&gt;')\n)\n\n# Define server logic required to draw a histogram\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n  \n}\n\n# Run the application \nshinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)\nShiny will assume that the code you pass to HTML is correctly written HTML. Be sure to double check it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIt is a bad idea to pass an input object to HTML:\ntags$div(\n  HTML(input$text)\n)\nThis allows the user to add their own HTML to your app, which creates a security vulnerability. What you user enters could be added to the web document or seen by other users, which might break the app. In the worse case scenario, a user may try to deploy malicious Cross Site Scripting (XSS), an undesirable security vulnerability.",

Inline or file based.\n\n1.

This approach reduces the time spent switching between files and eliminates the need for creating and linking external CSS files, simplifying the development process. However, drawbacks arise when the CSS code grows significantly, leading to a cluttered and unwieldy UI function within the app script.Therefore, inlining is most suitable during initial development stages when the CSS is concise, but as the codebase expands, transitioning to a file-based workflow becomes necessary for better organization and maintainability.\n\n\nFile based\nYou can keep your css script in a separate file in the www/ folder.\nA note about www/\nOne thing you may notice is that we placed our CSS file in the sub folder www/, but we only specified the CSS file’s name (dark_mode.css) in our href or “hyperlink reference” argument. The www/ folder is a special one for Shiny. Resources your app may link to, such as images—or in this case, scripts—are placed in the www/ folder. Shiny then knows to make these files available for access from the web browser. If we had placed dark_mode.css at the same file hierarchy next as app.R, Shiny would not know that it needs to host it, and your app would tell the browser to look for a file that was not available to\nIn www/style.css\n/* Get a fancy font from Google Fonts */\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Yusei+Magic&display=swap');\n\nbody {\n  background-color: black;\n  color: white; /* text color */\n}\n\n/* Change header text to imported font */\nh2 {\n  font-family: 'Yusei Magic', sans-serif;\n}\n\n/* Make text visible on inputs */\n.shiny-input-container {\n  color: #474747;\n}\napp.R\n\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\n  tags$head(\n    tags$link(rel = \"stylesheet\", type = \"text/css\", href = \"style.css\")\n  )\n  ...\n)\ntags$link: This is an HTML tag used to link external resources such as stylesheets (CSS files) or other documents.

That’s why elements like tabsetPanel(), actionButton(), … have been rewritten to provide full Bootstrap4 support. In addition, bs4Dash comes with extra elements that will help you to develop Shiny apps with a more professional look and feel.\nAll features are summarised on the website.\nA bs4dash demo is available here.\nThe code used to produce the demo is available here.",
